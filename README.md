# What does InstaAr do?

Add Images in real life with motion tracking, Sketch in mid air and even add Gifs stickers and videos live in your real 3D space through augmented reality
InstaAr makes use of Sceneform SDK and ARCore SDK provided by Google 

# Sceneform and ARCore makes AR a joy

I've used both the SDKS mentioned above for quick surface recognition so the user is ready to go instantly with whatever content they like

# Sketch in 3D space in real life
The app generates a live 3D extract of a sphere so the user can doodle noodly content in the 3D space in the air around them, record and share it, similar to a sample app by google

# Add music and record
I have used Intents to grab music from local storage, use FFMPEG to combine it video frames and then record the entire video sequence using Camera 2 API by Android
